# Cardano DEVELOPMENT HANDBOOK #

Welcome to the Cardano dev handbook. This is where we will document the processes
we follow in software development teams. We will cover how we manage the
development itself as well as standards for continuous integration and how we
manage dependencies.

## GitHub ##

We use github for hosting our git repositries and managing development tasks and
milestones.
