We as developers should be proud of the work we do: from the smallest artifacts
to the more complex products. This means taking responsibility for maintaining
the quality of our work. For instance, when a discussion on slack makes
reference to something that would require changes in our code base to ensure
its correctness, this should be added as a github issue, so that action can be
taken and important information is not lost in the slack noise.

If we feel like we lack a sense of ownership, this should be discussed with
other peers, to see whether it is possible to change this situation.
