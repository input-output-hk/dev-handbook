We want to set up our open source reops is a way that's consistent and that
encourages participation from the community

# README #

Every repo should have a readme file that contains the following sections

## Introduction ##

A description of the project and its purpose

## Building ##

How to build the project and how it is tested. If possible we should embed the
status of CI as a button.

## Usage Examples ##

Library code should contain examples of use

## Contributing ##

Guidlelines on how to contribute to the project. This section should point to
the documentation on how we use [GitHub](github-process.md) and instructions on
how to submit issues and pull requests. It should also point to the style guide
and coding standards for the main languages of the project.


# Issue templates #

These should be set up and be as similar as possible as other projects within
IOHK that use the same programming environment.
