# Zenhub


Zenhub is a addition to github we use for tracking project related data

{{< vimeo 207024351 >}}

## Set up

ZenHub is both a stand alone web app and a browser extension that modifies the
github UI to overlay information. The first thing to do is register and install
the browser extension:

link="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zenhub-for-github/ogcgkffhplmphkaahpmffcafajaocjbd"
target="_blank"
>}}

After you've registered have a read through the [Concepts](./concepts/) section
(or hit the arrow on the right).
