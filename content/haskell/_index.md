# How we write Haskell

The majority of cardano is written in the statically typed functional language
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/)

This section lays out the standard we expect for the Haskell written at Cardano. We
want to maintain consistency and quality across all of our repos. This includes
coding style and formatting as well as best practice and recommendations.
