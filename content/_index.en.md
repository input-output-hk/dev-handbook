## Documentation website
This current documentation has been statically generated with Hugo. If you want
 to run and build locally you can do so by cloning [available here at
 GitHub](https://github.com/input-output-hk/dev-handbook) and then running the
 following: `hugo server -D`

 The documentation is also automatically built on any PR or branch and deployed when the master branch changes
